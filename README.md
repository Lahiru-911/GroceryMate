# GroceryMate: Smart Grocery Delivery System

## Problem in Brief

Managing household groceries can be a time-consuming and inefficient process. People often forget to restock essential items like fruits and vegetables, leading to situations where they run out of necessary supplies. Conversely, over-purchasing groceries can result in waste, especially with perishable items.

### Challenges with Existing Solutions
Current solutions, such as online grocery delivery services, require users to:
- **Manually place orders** and monitor inventory themselves.
- Deal with **errors, delays, and inconvenience**, especially for busy individuals or families.

### The Gap
There is no automated system that:
1. **Tracks consumption patterns.**
2. **Predicts when groceries will run out.**
3. **Triggers timely reordering** to ensure a steady supply of fresh items.

### The Need
A smarter, technology-driven solution is required to:
- Ensure households always have essential groceries available.
- Minimize the manual effort required for grocery management.
- Reduce food waste caused by over-purchasing or expiration.

GroceryMate aims to bridge this gap by offering a fully automated, efficient, and reliable grocery delivery system.
